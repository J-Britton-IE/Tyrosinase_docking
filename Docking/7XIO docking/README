This folder contains .pdb files of the crystal structure of R. solanacearum 7XIO.pdb docked with tyrosine and tyrosol. 
Docking of these substrates with a truncated crystal structure 7XIO_cat.pdb which contains only the catalytic domain of R. solanacearum tyrosinase is also found here.
All docking structures were generated with the CCDC GOLD software.

The naming convention for files is as follows:
Model name + substrate .pdb

Model names:
7XIO.pdb = Crystal structure of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase which has been modified to fill in sequence gaps and introduce copper cofactors.
7XIO_cat.pdb = Crystal structure of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase which is truncated to contain only the tyrosinase catalytic domain with copper cofactors.
