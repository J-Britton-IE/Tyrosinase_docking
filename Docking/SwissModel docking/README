This folder contains .pdb files of a SwissModel generated homology model of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase docked with a selection of substrates.
These homology models cover only the tyrosinase catalytic domain of the enzyme.
All docking structures were generated with the CCDC GOLD software.

The naming convention for files is as follows:
Model name + substrate abbreviation . pdb

Model name:
RsTyr_SM = SwissModel homology model of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase 


Substrate abbreviations:
Tyrosine = N/A
Tyrosol = N/A
Resveratrol = N/A
Phenol = N/A
Tyramine = N/A
Octopamine = N/A
2-Fluorophenol = 2-FP
3-Fluorophenol = 3-FP
4-hydroxybenzoic acid = 4-HBA
4-hydroxymandelic acid = 4-HMA
4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid = 4-HPAA
