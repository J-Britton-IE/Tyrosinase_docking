This folder contains .pdb files of an AlphaFold model of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase docked with a selection of substrates.
Docking of these substrates with a truncated AlphaFold model which contains only the catalytic domain of R. solanacearum tyrosinase is also found here.
All docking structures were generated with the CCDC GOLD software.

The naming convention for files is as follows:
Substrate abbreviation + Model type . pdb

Model names:
AF = AlphaFold model of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase 
AF_catalytic = AlphaFold model of the R. solanacearum tyrosinase which is truncated to contain only the tyrosinase catalytic domain.

Substrate abbreviations:
Tyrosine = N/A
Tyrosol = N/A
Resveratrol = N/A
Phenol = N/A
Tyramine = N/A
Octopamine = N/A
2-Fluorophenol = 2-FP
3-Fluorophenol = 3-FP
4-hydroxybenzoic acid = 4-HBA
4-hydroxymandelic acid = 4-HMA
4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid = 4-HPAA
4-methoxyphenylacetic acid = 4-MPAA
